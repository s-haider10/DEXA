# DEXA: Data Exploration via eXplanatory AI

**DEXA** (Data Exploration via eXplanatory AI) is a framework designed to translate natural language queries into safe, explainable, and executable code for multimodal dataset analysis. It leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside schema-aware prompt engineering to generate code, visualizations, and textual explanations of data.

DEXA supports both **zero-shot** and **few-shot** prompting modes, with a feedback loop for safety and interpretability. It has been evaluated on real-world datasets through both automated metrics and human feedback using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA-4).
